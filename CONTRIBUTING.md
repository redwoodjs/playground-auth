## Adding a provider

Adding a provider example follows the process:

1. Create a provider component in `web/src/components`
  - Make sure to export the client as well
2. Add the provider logo to `web/src/lib/images`
  - The file should be a png and the name should match the provider slug in all lowercase
3. Add example code to `web/src/lib/code-samples`
  - The markdown file name should match the provider slug
4. Add the provider name, slug, client, and component to `web/src/lib/providers.js`
